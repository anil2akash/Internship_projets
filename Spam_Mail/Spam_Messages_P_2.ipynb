       " 'several week ago sent inquiry est ce que interrogative list many took time answer feel sorry giving summary reply today written one french display would like translation please ask write one thanks precious collaboration inquiry j ai rencontre l enonce authentique suivant people never happy qui ressemble beaucoup au fran ai pourquoi est ce que le gen ne sont jamais content j aimerais savoir il est possible de poser une question de la meme maniere avec said saying met meeting met meeting sur le reponses obtenues consistent en une phrase tous ce exemples paraissent acceptables et normaux le auteur de autres reponses ont tres majoritairement accepte tous le exemples egalement mais avec quelques restriction emploi que nous developpons ici le quatre grand type de restriction sont le registre de langue employe la semantique de l interrogative la nature de l adverbe interrogatif et le temp du verbe etre place avant le registre employe est juge pertinent pour l acceptabilite de la structure comme le montrent le six remarques suivantes alors que le phrase proposees seraient appropriees dans un registre tres formel de equivalent plus courants colloquial seraient said saying whatj met meeting whoj met meeting whenj howj j cet equivalent courant n existe pa cependant avec je dirais plutot people never seem happy j convient mais ne semble pa tres naturel l emploi de marque un registre plus formel le exemples semblent appropries dans tous le registres peut etre un peu moins frequents dans un ecrit tres formel toutes ce question sont parfaitement ordinaires j attribue ce phrase au registre courant colloquial plutot que litteraire je dirais que ce phrase seraient acceptees par n importe quel locuteur americanophone au moins dans une conversation informelle le commentaires divergent certains locuteurs attribuant le exemples un registre formel autres un registre non formel la premiere personne optant pour le registre formel precise que ce type enonce est caracteristique une question que poserait par exemple un avocat au cours un proces mais c est peut etre plutot la semantique de la question qui importe ici et non le registre la deuxieme personne ayant choisi le registre formel semble cependant appuyer surtout sur la presence de en effet une autre reponse souligne la difference existant entre le formes et par consequent nous pouvons retenir de commentaires obtenus que la construction qui nous interesse releve globalement un registre courant voire familier mais peut se retrouver dans autres registres sou certaines formes avec v sans et pour exprimer certains actes de parole la semantique de l interrogative intervient elle aussi dans le choix de cette construction comme l attestent le remarques suivantes par rapport la construction plus traditionnelle celle ci se limite aux ca ou le locuteur exprime une repetition ou une clarification apres avoir pose la question sou la forme plus courante sayj said goodbye good riddancej saidj n listening closely cette construction marquee n est appropriee que si le discours precedent deja etabli qu il aura une reponse non negative la question ainsi l echange suivant ne semblerait pa naturel sawj nobody je n accepterais pa ou reagirais negativement la phrase thatj j emploie cette construction avec tous le autres adverbes pour obtenir un eclaircissement propos une chose deja mentionnee le exemples semblent normaux si le locuteur met l accent sur l adverbe interrogatif et exprime une certaine exasperation thing boughtj ce question sont tout fait acceptables moyennant un contexte discursif particulier du type reprise ou la meilleure acceptabilite de version dans lesquelles le verbe est marque de l aspect ing fondamentalement anaphorique cette construction met l emphase sur l element interrogatif spontanement je dirais que cette construction se focalise sur la question plus specifiquement si l demandait meetingj je pourrais repondre friend mais si la question etait meetingj je sentirais oblige de repondre plus precisement la seule raison justifiant l emploi de cette construction est mon avis l emphase qu elle met sur l objet de la question en anglais ce question sont posees de fa rhetorique ou pour exprimer une demande de clarification dans le deuxieme ca l element interrogatif est fortement accentue la plupart de ce question ressemblent une demande de repetition de quelque chose qui aurait ete mal compris la premiere audition le question de ce type correspondent la forme declarative emphatique x ou x saying ce question en anglais se traduiraient mieux en fran ai par quelque chose comme qui c est que tu vuj qui met aussi l accent sur la reponse la ou une question en est ce que normale ne le ferait pa cette construction entra ne aussi une accentuation plus forte sur l element interrogatif dans beaucoup de ca ce formes marqueraient une emphase utilisee par exemple si je pensais avoir mal compris un message said arej pour moi ce construction presupposent que quelqu un vous donne l information ou et que vous l avez oubliee et devez poser une question sur ce seul element toutes ce remarques accordent pour attribuer la construction qui nous interesse un sen emphatique utilise pour obtenir une clarification elle semble aussi accompagner une accentuation de l element interrogatif il est donc interessant de remarquer que la valeur emphatique est commune aux construction anglaise et fran aise parmi le reponses tentaient expliquer partiellement ou completement la variation de l acceptabilite de la construction en fonction de la nature de l adverbe interrogatif arej et thisj sont pour moi le construction le plus maladroites et le moins frequentes arej est maladroit je repeterais probablement la question youj en accentuant plus le je ne pense pa que le dans soit le meme que dans le construction avec le adverbes interrogatifs et sont toujours idiomatiques meme il sont plutot formels est idiomatique mais para assez pauvre le autres enonces identifieraient coup sur le locuteur comme etant etranger toutes ce construction sont possible excepte celle avec pour et je peux employer seulement avec le present avec le passe je dirais pour c est different parce que est une forme idiomatique signifiant pourquoi pour moi donc thisj convient si cela signifie pourquoi tu fait celaj si je veux vraiment savoir comment alors le temp doit correspondre comme avec le autres adverbes interrogatifs le construction avec et sont acceptables mais celles avec et ne semblent pa tres naturelles toutes le construction conviennent sauf peut etre la derniere avec qui para bizarre je pense qu il ne serait pa approprie employer dans aucune de situation mentionnees excepte j utiliserais cette construction avec seulement il etait suivi de je ne l emploierais pa avec et tous le exemples cite sont acceptables mais mise part la question avec et peut etre celle avec il ne semblent pa aussi generaux que la question ordinaire unmarked pour de raisons qui leur sont probablement propres et se distinguent de autres adverbes peut interpreter la fois comme une forme figee qui le sen de pourquoi come et comme une construction non figee signifiant comment cela explique le difference de perception de cette forme par le locuteurs qui n ont pa toujours pris en compte s deux sen egalement un comportement de forme figee mais qui garde le sen de pourquoi pourquoi est aussi un adverbe qui se demarque de autres en fran ai car la question qu il pose porte sur l ensemble de la phrase pourquoi tu en vasj mais tu en va pourquoij nous expliquons moins facilement la specificite de qui ete relevee reprises le dernier facteur acceptabilite egalement souvent cite huit fois par le natifs est le temp du verbe etre place avant toutes ce phrase emploient couramment en anglais noter qu peut aussi bien utiliser ce genre de structure au passe ran yesterdayj nous formons souvent de enonces come ceux que vous citez par exemple split ink book late say coming clock etc pour et je peux employer seulement avec le present avec le passe je dirais pour thisj et si je veux vraiment savoir comment alors le temp doit correspondre comme avec le autres adverbes interrogatifs toutes le phrase conviennent meme si dans plusieurs ca j ai pense qu il avait une meilleure alternative said saying aussi said met meeting aussi met met meeting avec met met est meilleur aussi avec est meilleur toutes le phrase sont bonnes elles seraient un peu meilleures si le temp de verbes accordaient le question conviennent toutes tant que le temp employe est correct quand l anglais emploie l expression le temp de verbes doivent correspondre dans la plupart de ca toutes le phrase sont parfaitement correctes sauf que normalement j accorderais le temp du premier verbe celui du second lorsque deuxieme la portion de la phrase est au passe par exemple met meeting met meeting nous pouvons sur ce point differencier le construction et est ce que la construction de l anglais etant beaucoup moins figee que celle du fran ai en effet le fran ai n accorderait pa le temp de deux verbes',\n",
