      "From pollutants present in the air to all the heat that goes into hair styling, there’s so much damage we cause to our tresses without even realising! Over time, our hair ends up losing its natural oil and lustre. And of course, this results in dry and damaged hair, which is rough to touch and prone to breakage. Quite the opposite of what we want, isn’t it?\n",

      "Eggs are rich in vitamin A and E, and also boast high protein content. They are not just great for moisturising the hair, but also strengthening it.

      "2. Banana and castor oil\n",
      "\n",
      "Bananas are rich in multiple vitamins, minerals and natural oils. Hence, they work extremely well to hydrate the hair as well as the scalp. Castor oil, which is rich in fatty acids, provides nourishment to dry and damaged hair. When combined, these ingredients can restore the moisture to dry hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Add three tablespoons of castor oil to 2 mashed bananas. You can adjust the quantity, according to your hair length. Apply this mixture to your hair and let it rest for about 20 minutes. Rinse your hair using warm water and a mild shampoo.\n",

      "3. Mayonnaise and aloe vera\n",
      "\n",
      "Aloe vera, which contains a high quantity of water, is well-known for its hydrating properties. Mayonnaise may sound like a bizarre ingredient to add to your hair packs, but the eggs and oil in it can prove to be extremely moisturising for your hair.\n",

      "Add two tablespoons of aloe vera to two tablespoons of mayonnaise. Apply this to your hair and let it rest for 30 minutes, before rinsing with a mild shampoo.\n",

      "Coconut oil has been used since time immemorial to treat dry and damaged hair. It is highly moisturising, and can provide the nourishment that dry hair needs to restore its lustre. Honey, a natural humectant, will help you retain the moisture provided by coconut oil. Moreover, its antibacterial properties help you steer clear of scalp infections.\n",
